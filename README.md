#Topotext 

TopoText is an interactive tool for digital mapping of literary text. TopoText
takes as input a literary piece of text such as a novel or a biography article and automatically
extracts all place names in the text. The identified places are then geoparsed and displayed on
an interactive map. TopoText calculates the number of times a place was mentioned in the text,
which is then reflected on the map allowing the end-user to grasp the importance of the different
places within the text. It also displays the most frequent words mentioned within a specified
proximity of a place name in context or across the entire text. This can also be faceted according
to part of speech tags. Finally, TopoText keeps the human in the loop by allowing the end-user
to disambiguate places and to provide specific place annotations. All extracted information such
as geolocations, place frequencies, word clouds as well as all user-provided annotations can be
automatically exported as a CSV file that can be imported later by the same user or any other
user.
